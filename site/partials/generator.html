                <p>This study is being conducted by <strong>Jamie Birch</strong> <em>(correspondence: <u>jb15339+vocab</u> <u>[at]</u> <u>my.bristol.ac.uk</u>)</em> for the evaluation of his MSc Computer Science dissertation project on <strong>optimising the study of technical/topic-specific vocabulary in Japanese</strong>. He is a student in the Engineering Department of the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~flach/">Prof. Peter Flach.</a></p>
                <p>The study consists of three parts:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Taking a quiz to measure current level of comprehension of a topic <em>[est. 7 minutes]</em></li>
                  <li>Studying a topic from a vocabulary list (except for those in the control group) <em>[this will take only as much time as you choose; eg. you may cram for 30 minutes, or revise over several days]</em></li>
                  <li>Taking another quiz to measure any changes in comprehension of the topic, as well as giving feedback <em>[est. 10 minutes]</em></li>
                </ol>
                <p>I shall also be asking participants to fill in a small demographic survey (below) so that demographic effects may be measured. Note that nonetheless, most fields are optional.</p>
                <p class="helpy"><em>Data stored is limited to: the user-provided demographic information; the website-provided access ID; the website-generated vocabulary list and quizzes; timestamps of events; user feedback; and the user's performance during the website-generated quizzes. Information on unstated data such as IP address will not be taken.</em></p>

                <p>All data begins and will remain anonymous (eg. phrasing in the dissertation will resemble the format of: "participant #3, who claimed a high level of environmental exposure to Japanese") and confidential.

                <p>Participants may request a PDF copy of the final dissertation, which is scheduled to be submitted on 12th September and - to my understanding - will be stored in print in the University of Bristol library.</p>
                <p>Participants have a right to have their data withdrawn from the study upon request until 20th August, whereupon the data shall be considered usable in the final dissertation write-up.</p>
